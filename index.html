        <h2>I like aliens</h2>
        <p>I'm 90% sure that they're real. The other 10% is that the Earth, Sun, and Moon are the only things out there, which would mean there's no possibility of aliens ðŸ˜ž.</p>

        <h2>I like to game</h2>
        <p>Here are some of my favorite games: <b>Satisfactory</b>, <b>Broforce</b>, <b>TF2</b>, and <b>Watch Dogs 2</b>. But I currently don't game much because I actually need to study.</p>
